# try-and-run-the-7-huskylens-built-in-functions
In the Smart Methods AI track, our task involves exploring and running the seven built-in functions of the Huskylens. The Huskylens is an AI vision sensor that simplifies the integration of visual recognition capabilities in projects. Here’s a brief overview of each function:

1. **Face Recognition**: This function allows the Huskylens to recognize and differentiate between multiple human faces. It's commonly used in applications like security systems and personalized user experiences.

2. **Object Tracking**: This feature enables the sensor to follow a specific object in real-time. It's useful for robotics, allowing machines to track and interact with objects dynamically.

3. **Object Recognition**: The Huskylens can recognize various predefined objects. This function is essential for identifying and categorizing items in automation and inventory management systems.

4. **Line Tracking**: This function detects and follows lines, making it perfect for line-following robots used in industrial and educational settings.

5. **Color Recognition**: The sensor can identify and differentiate between different colors. This is useful in sorting systems and for interactive projects where color differentiation is necessary.

6. **Tag Recognition**: This function allows the Huskylens to recognize and decode specific tags or markers. It’s particularly useful in augmented reality (AR) applications and navigation systems for robots.

7. **Object Classification**: The sensor can classify objects into different categories based on their features. This advanced function is used in machine learning applications to automate decision-making processes.

By exploring these functions, we can leverage the Huskylens to enhance our robotics projects, making them more interactive and intelligent. This will enable our robots to recognize faces, track and classify objects, follow lines, identify colors, and decode tags, greatly expanding their capabilities and applications.
